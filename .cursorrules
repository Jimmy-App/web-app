- Keep features isolated under src/features with api.ts, schemas.ts, and components.
- Use mockDb and mockAuth from src/lib/mock-db.ts for all data access.
- Import Prisma types from @prisma/client; avoid redefining model types.
- App Router pages should delegate UI to feature components.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components from src/components/ui.
- Forms use React Hook Form + Zod with loading and error states.
- Sidebar and org switcher live under src/components/layout.
